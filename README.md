Fail high load with open source software

It is easy to get and use XYZ for every project, even high loaded one. 

You might ask why is that? 

The answer is simple. XYZ is an outstanding mature open source project, used by lots of companies around the globe. 
But is it a good fit for your specific needs? 

In this talk I'll try to test every XYZ used in one particular project, under some kind of high load. May be you can't fail high load with OSS like XYZ, or may be not.
